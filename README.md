# graphviz-personal-projects-development
A place to store architecture models as code for my personal projects. This is code in development and may get absorbed elsewhere later.

This code requires use of [GraphvizOnline](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/) to compile, and is useful for outputting into a variety of visual or code formats.

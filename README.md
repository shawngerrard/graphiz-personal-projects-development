# personal-projects-development
A place to store code relating to personal projects. This is code in development and may get absorbed elsewhere later.

## Prerequisites / Considerations
1. Ensure your installed modules are up-to-date.

```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade```

2. The code in the .dot extension files require use of [GraphvizOnline](https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/) to compile, and is useful for outputting into a variety of visual or code formats to view architectural models.

3. You will need the Python package manager (pip3 for Python v3 or higher) to install the AWS CLI.

```sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip```

**Note:** If you follow [James Blair's WSL tooling setup](https://github.com/jmhbnz/tooling/blob/master/wsl-setup.org), this should be already installed.

4. You will need to install the latest version of the [AWS CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli).

```sudo apt-get install -y awscli ```
